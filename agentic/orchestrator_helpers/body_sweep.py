"""Delete the route exposure body files a session left in the Kali sandbox.

The route exposure parts keep every response body in a kali file named
`/tmp/rex-...`, delete it in the script that reads it, and sweep what is left
before `transition_phase` or `complete`. Live sessions skipped that sweep (a
rejected lead's two bodies stayed on disk), so the end of a run sweeps in code.

Only the paths this session named in its own tool arguments are removed. The
sandbox is shared by every session, so a glob would delete another session's
bodies mid-read; tool outputs are not read either, since a printed `glob` listing
can name files that are not this session's.
