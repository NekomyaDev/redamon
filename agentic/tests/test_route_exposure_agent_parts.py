"""The route-exposure parts of access_control, path_traversal and rce (plan §23.12).

With recon's route exposure module off, the three skills render byte-identical
text (the golden's ALL_OFF hashes). With it on, the new parts follow the
existing ones; each gated part is absent unless its switch AND the RoE allow it,
and its parent prints ENABLED / DISABLED to match. Every part names real tools
only and carries the record contract, the verify step, the rejection rule, the
forbidden actions and the values-in-files rule.
