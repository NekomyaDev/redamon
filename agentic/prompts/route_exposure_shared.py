### Values stay in files (never in this conversation)

A tool result reaches the model, and a large one is only cut to a head and a tail,
so a body must never be a tool's output. Every recipe here:

1. writes the body to a kali-local file with execute_curl:
   `-s -o /tmp/rex-<id>-anon.body -w '%{http_code} %{size_download} %{content_type}' '<url>'`
   (flat names: curl -o creates no directory). execute_curl and execute_code run in
   the same kali sandbox, so execute_code reads that file; the fs_* tools work in the
   agent's /workspace and never see it, which is the point.
2. reads it with ONE execute_code script that prints only derived facts: status
   codes, sizes, key names, counts, kinds, valid/invalid, and 8-character SHA-256
   prefixes. Never a value, record, secret, token or cookie.
3. deletes it in that same script (os.remove) and prints nothing else from it.

Before `switch_skill`, `transition_phase` or `complete`, the execute_code you run
also removes every `/tmp/rex-*` file still there (glob, os.remove) and prints only
how many it removed: a body left behind is a value left on disk.

With `use_session=true` the flags `-v`, `-i`, `--trace`, `-D -` and `-o -` are
FORBIDDEN: they would echo the session's headers, a Set-Cookie or the body.
"""

RECORD_CONTRACT = """
### Recording a proof (same response, then verify)

- Fill `output_analysis.chain_findings` IN THE SAME RESPONSE that reads the proof
  (it is a field, not a tool): `finding_type: "vulnerability_confirmed"`,
  `related_finding_ids: ["<the exact id>"]`, `confidence` 80 or more, a `title` naming
  the route and what it proves, and `evidence` (statuses, sizes, hash prefixes, key
  names). Only a proof type at 70 or more promotes the node to T1.
- "Record X as confirmed" written in `actionable_findings`, `thought` or `reasoning`
  records NOTHING: it is kept as a note without an id. Only a `chain_findings` entry
  writes the CONFIRMS edge.
- ONE id per entry.
- A lead (`needs_agent_confirmation = true`) is confirmed ONLY in the access_control
  skill, against its proof standard: from any other skill its id writes nothing.
  Leave such a lead alone and name it in your final answer.
- NEVER put ids on `exploit_success`, `access_gained` or `credential_found`: those
  entries are dropped from the CONFIRMS path when an exploit succeeded, so the id
  would be lost silently. Record the confirmation first, then the impact (a
  console's output, a credential) as its own entry with NO ids.
- Before `action="complete"`, verify each one:
  `MATCH (cf:ChainFinding)-[:CONFIRMS]->(v:Vulnerability {id:'<ID>'}) RETURN cf.finding_type`.
  Missing means the entry was never in `chain_findings` or its id was wrong (both
  write nothing, silently): put the entry in your NEXT response's `chain_findings`
  with the exact id, before any `switch_skill` or `transition_phase`.
- A lead you REJECT (public by design, nothing sensitive) gets NO entry at all:
  list it in your final answer as rejected, with the reason.
"""

SAFETY_RULES = """
### Safety (these hold whatever the target answers)

- Methods: only GET, HEAD and OPTIONS against a lead's or a finding's URL (plus the
  single `1+1` console request where the rce part allows it). No form submit, no
  write, no DELETE, even on an open admin route.
- Actuator: never POST to any `/actuator/*` path; never run the nuclei templates
  `springboot-env-rce-chains` or `springboot-jolokia-rce` (they restart the
  application). `springboot-heapdump-bypass` is detection-only and allowed.
- Consoles: never guess or compute a PIN; never run an Ignition exploit chain.
- Origins: attacker origins use `.invalid`; a PoC file is written, never served; no
  live exfiltration endpoint.
- Values stay in files (above). Evidence holds key names, counts, statuses, header
  names and hash prefixes only.
- The tool confirmation, the RoE categories, the severity-phase cap and the phase
  gates still apply. Nothing here is a way around them.
