"""
Route privacy ranking on TypeSafe Jev (route exposure, hook A)
=============================================================
The route exposure scan spends a request budget per host, floor first, then by a
deterministic prior score (OpenAPI security, path words, generator). This hook
asks Jev one noul per route: is it meant only for logged-in, internal or
administrative callers? Under ACT (later) the budget after the floor would be
filled by that answer; it never drops a floor route and never invents one.

Shipped in SHADOW: the order and the requests are exactly the deterministic ones,
and each answer is recorded next to the prior score's own verdict (score >= 5 is
"private") in the recon JSON `jev_shadow.route_privacy_rank`.

Items are tiny (a path, a method, a closed category and four flags), so one
request carries many; the path is target text and is only ever state data on the
agent side, named by index. Log lines carry counts only.

Kind B (no LLM twin), gated by AI_IN_PIPELINE and ROUTE_EXPOSURE_JEV_RANK at the
call site inside run_route_exposure, so a partial run inherits it.
